                    <p class="card sub">The Ferrari F40 is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina.
                        It was built from 1987 to 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively.
                        As the successor to the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary and was 
                        the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most 
                        expensive car for sale.The car debuted with a planned production total of 400 units and a factory suggested retail price of 
                        approximately US$400,000 (fivefold the price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO) in 1987 ($910,000 today). </p>
